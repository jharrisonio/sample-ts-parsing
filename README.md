# Sample Typescript Parsing
This repo contains example code that reads a Typescript file and parses it with the Typescript Compiler, converting it into an Abstract Syntax Tree in JSON format.

## Getting started
1. `$ npm i`
2. `$ npm start`
3. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)


## How it works
The app picks up `./src/sample-files/index.ts` and parses it. Try changing the content of that file and refreshing the page.
